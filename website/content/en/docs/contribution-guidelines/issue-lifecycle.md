The Operator SDK project tracks bugs, feature requests, and questions
with [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues).

## Triage

Each week, there is a [community
meeting](https://github.com/operator-framework/community/#operator-sdk-community-issue-triagegrooming)
to triage issues. Each issue that has been filed since the previous
meeting is discussed, GitHub labels are applied, and the issue is added
to a Milestone. Additionally, anyone can request that a previously
triaged issue can be retriaged.

## Grooming

Following a release, there is a community meeting to review issues that
are desired in the next release. Issues are discussed in the following
order:

- Issues in the next release milestone
- Issues labeled as `priority/important-soon`
- Issues in other milestones/backlog if specifically requested
