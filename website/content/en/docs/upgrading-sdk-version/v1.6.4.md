## Ensure that existing dependent resources have owner annotations

For Ansible-based operators, [owner reference annotations](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/ansible/reference/retroactively-owned-resources/)
on cluster-scoped dependent resources and dependent resources in other namespaces were not applied correctly.
A workaround was to add these annotations manually, which is no longer required as this bug has been fixed.

_See [#4858](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4858) for more details._
