## v1.6.4

### Bug Fixes

- For Ansible-based operators, fixed a bug that prevented owner reference annotations from being added to cluster-scoped and multi-namespace resources, which had to be applied manually to correctly reconcile them. ([#4858](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4858))
- Format ansible-operator and helm-operator `run` command logs correctly. ([#4845](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4845))
- Pinned pip3 to 21.1 in the ansible-operator image to fix https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/9827. ([#4879](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4879))
- Pinned base images of ansible-operator to ubi:8.3-297.1618432833, and helm-operator and scorecard to ubi-minimal:8.3-298.1618432845. ([#4876](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4876))
